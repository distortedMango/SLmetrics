{SLmetrics} is a collection of (lightning fast) performance evaluation metrics for regression and classification models written in c++ and [{Rcpp}](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp); it's like using a supercharged [{yardstick}](https://github.com/tidymodels/yardstick) to measure model performance, without the risk of soft to super-hard deprecations.

## :information_source: Basic usage

In its most basic form the functions can be used as-is without any pipelines, data.frames or recipes,

```{r}
# 1) run regression
model <- lm(
  formula = mpg ~ .,
  data    = mtcars
)

# 2) evaluate RMSE
rmse(
  actual    = mtcars$mpg,
  predicted = fitted(model)
)
```

<summary> For Developers </summary>

As {SLMetrics} assumes that the user has some degree of control over the training process of the various models and the resulting output, the functions does not validate the input.

If you want to include the functions as a part of your R-package and introduce some defensive measures a possible strategy is as follows,

```{r}
## 1) create a wrapper
## function
RMSE <- function(
    actual,
    predicted,
    w = NULL) {
  
  # 0) defensive measures
  # for user
  stopifnot(
    length(actual) == length(predicted)
    )
  
  stopifnot(
    is.numeric(actual) & is.numeric(predicted)
  )
  
  if (!is.null(w)) {
    
    stopifnot(
      is.numeric(w)
      )
    
    output <- wrmse(
      actual    = actual,
      predicted = predicted,
      w         = w
    )
    
  } else {
    
    output <- rmse(
      actual    = actual,
      predicted = predicted
    )
    
  }
  
  return(output)
  
}
```

```{r}
# 1) run regression
model <- lm(
  formula = mpg ~ .,
  data    = mtcars
)

# 2) evaluate RMSE
RMSE(
  actual    = mtcars$mpg,
  predicted = fitted(model)
)
```
